# Type in Markdown - Privacy Policy

The Type in Markdown add-on does not collect or distribute any information about you or about the documents being converted.

Required permissions:

Type in Markdown will ask for permission to access the current Doc (to convert it). Type in Markdown reads the Doc content and structure.

Type in Markdown will also ask for permission to display a sidebar. It uses the sidebar to display guides and extra information around Markdown syntax.

It requires no other permissions.
